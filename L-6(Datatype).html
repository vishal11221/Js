    <title>Datatypes in javascript</title>
</head>
<body>
    <ol>
        <li>Primitive Datatypes:- 
            <ol>
                <li>String:-it define with single,double and backticks.it store character values</li>
                <li>Number:-it define the numeric value as well as float value also.</li>
                <li>Bollean:- it define only true and false value.</li>
                <li>Null:-it store empty value.</li>
                <li>Undefined:-When we declare variable but not store any value in it.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Non-Primitive Datatypes:- 
            <ol>
                <li>Array:-it store multiple type of data in single variable but in Array format,We see the Array value with the help of foreach loop</li>
                <li>Object:-it store multiple type of data in single variable but in object form,We see the Object value with the help of forin loop</li>
                <li>Function:-it is set of block of code that is used when we call it.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>We also find the datatype of variables with "type of" operator.<br>
        as:- typeOf 10,it return Number</li>
        <li>Why javascript also called dynamic language ? <br>
             JavaScript is dynamic typed language because in js no need to declare the datatype of variables.</li>
             <li>Is javascript is statically typed language or dynamic typed language ? <br>
                 Js is dynamically typed language but Typescript is statically type language.<br>
                  In dynamically typed language all the type checks are performed in a runtime,only when your program is executing,so this means you can just assign anything you want to the variable and it will work.<br>If we take a look at Typescript,it is a statically typed language,So all checks will be performed during compile.</li>
                  <li>JavaScript is Cross-platform or not ? <br>
                      Js is Cross-platform,we run js to any platform like,MAC,Windows,linux and so on.</li>
    </ol>
